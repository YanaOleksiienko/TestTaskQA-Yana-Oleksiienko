Hello, Yanina.

Task 1 you can find in files Multiplier.js and Palindrome.js

Task 2 you can fund in files TestMultiplier.js and TestPalindrome.js. As it's JS functions I decided that unit tests will be better way to check its functionality.

Task 3 you can find here. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S-RJdPkb6O6nQIICQdpKd4bukfvOK-Spt2etohKBMO4/edit#gid=1478349058 
There was a problem with registration from Ukraine (in the contacts you can see Ukraine in the list of countries, but during registration not) so I reported it as one of the bugs. To registrate with VPN as user from another country there was not possible too, because you can't go throught the phone number varification (or if not using VPN just to try to write that you from another country your IP adress is blocked because the geolocation does not match the selected country). Considering that almost all the functionality is available only to a registered user, I did not reported more critical bugs. Instead, I found 2 bugs, but with a lower priority.
